## Algo Trading Process
The process of running a quantitave investing strategy can be broken down into the following steps:
* Collect Data
* Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
* Backtest that strategy
* Implement the strategy in production

## How this course will be different than algorithmic trading in production:
Because this is an intoductory course, it will differ from production algorithmic trading in 3 different ways:
* We'll be using random data
* We will not be executing trades
* We will be saving recommended trades to excel files
